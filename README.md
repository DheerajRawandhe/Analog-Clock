  # Analog-Clock-
I build an Analog Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project visually represents time with a real-time moving hour, minute, and second hand. 

The clock updates dynamically using JavaScript's setInterval() function to ensure accurate time display. CSS is used to style the clock face, hands, and layout, making it look modern and responsive. The project enhances JavaScript skills by working with the Date object and DOM manipulation.
